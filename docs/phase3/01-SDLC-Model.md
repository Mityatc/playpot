## 5. Sprint Structure Design

### 5.1 Sprint Timeline (1 Week Sprints)

#### **Sprint Duration Justification:**
- **Volleyball Schedule:** Matches every Sunday provide natural sprint boundaries
- **Feedback Loop:** Weekly feedback is optimal for rapid iteration
- **Student Schedule:** Manageable alongside studies and other commitments
- **Motivation:** Frequent progress demonstrations maintain momentum

### 5.2 Sprint Events Schedule

#### **Sprint Planning (Monday 1-2 hours)**
```
Location: Online/Study space
Attendees: Product Owner + Development Team
Inputs: 
  - Refined product backlog
  - Velocity from previous sprint
  - Volleyball player feedback from Sunday
Outputs:
  - Sprint goal
  - Sprint backlog
  - Task breakdown
```

#### **Daily Standups (Tuesday-Friday 15 mins)**
```
Format: Async updates (solo developer)
Questions:
  - What did I accomplish yesterday?
  - What will I work on today?
  - What blockers do I have?
Documentation: Daily progress log
```

#### **Sprint Review (Sunday 30 mins)**
```
Location: Volleyball venue (after match)
Attendees: All volleyball players + organizers
Format: Live demo on mobile device
Focus: Show working features in volleyball context
```

#### **Sprint Retrospective (Sunday 30 mins)**
```
Timing: After sprint review
Format: Informal discussion with volleyball community
Focus: What worked well? What could improve?
Output: Action items for next sprint
```

### 5.3 Definition of Done

A user story is "Done" when:
- [ ] Feature implemented and tested
- [ ] Code reviewed (self-review + documentation)
- [ ] Works on mobile device
- [ ] Tested with real volleyball data
- [ ] User acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Demo-ready for volleyball players
- [ ] Documentation updated

## 6. User Story Management

### 6.1 Story Estimation Technique

**Planning Poker Adaptation for Solo Developer:**
- Use Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
- Consider complexity, uncertainty, and effort
- Validate estimates against actual time spent
- Adjust velocity based on learning curve

**Estimation Guidelines:**
- **1 point:** Simple UI component (< 2 hours)
- **2 points:** Basic CRUD operation (2-4 hours)
- **3 points:** Complex form with validation (4-8 hours)
- **5 points:** Feature with business logic (1-2 days)
- **8 points:** Complex feature with multiple components (2-3 days)
- **13 points:** Epic requiring breakdown

### 6.2 Backlog Prioritization Framework

**MoSCoW Method Applied to Volleyball Context:**

#### **Must Have (High Priority)**
- Admin authentication
- Team creation and management
- Player addition to teams
- Match creation with stake setting
- Match result recording
- Automatic stake distribution

#### **Should Have (Medium Priority)**
- Player statistics entry
- Basic leaderboards
- Financial reporting
- Match history view

#### **Could Have (Low Priority)**
- Advanced analytics
- Player performance charts
- Team comparison features
- Export capabilities

#### **Won't Have (Future Versions)**
- Tournament management
- Payment gateway integration
- Social media integration
- Video/photo uploads

### 6.3 User Story Template

```
As a [user type]
I want [functionality]
So that [business value]

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Criterion 1
